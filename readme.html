		<h1>Getting Started </h1>
		Welcome to React Native! This page will help you install React Native on your system, so that you can build apps with it right away. <br>
		If you already have React Native installed, you can skip ahead to the Tutorial. <br>

		The instructions are a bit different depending on your development operating system, 
		and whether you want to start developing for iOS or Android.<br> 
		If you want to develop for both iOS and Android, 
		that's fine - you just have to pick one to start with, since the setup is a bit different.<br><br>

		Mobile OS: 
		<strong> iOS</strong><mark> Android</mark> 
		Development OS: 
		<strog> Mac</strog><strog> Linux</strog><mark> Windows</mark><br><br>

		<h1>Dependencies for <mark><i>Windows + Android</i></mark></h1>

		You will need <strong>node.js</strong>, the <strong>React Native command line tools</strong>, 
		<strong>Watchman</strong>, and <strong>Android Studio</strong>.<br><br>

		We recommend installing <code>node.js</code> and <code>Python2</code> via <strong>Chocolatey</strong>, 
		a popular package manager for Windows. Open a Command Prompt as Administrator, then run:<br><br>

		<code>
			choco install nodejs.install
			choco install python2
		</code>
		<br><br>
		Node comes with <strong>npm</strong>, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.<br><br>

		<code>
			npm install -g react-native-cli
		</code>
		<br><br>
		Download and install <strong>Android Studio</strong>.<br><br>

		If you plan to make changes in Java code, we recommend <strong>Gradle Daemon</strong> which speeds up the build.<br><br>

		<h1>Testing your React Native Installation </h1><br><br>

		Use the React Native command line tools to generate a new React Native project called "<i>AwesomeProject</i>",<br>
		then run <code>react-native run-android</code> inside the newly created folder.<br><br>

		<code>
			react-native init AwesomeProject<br>
			cd AwesomeProject<br>
			react-native run-android<br>
		</code><br><br>

		If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your <strong> Android emulator</strong> shortly.<br><br>

		A common issue is that the packager is not started automatically when you run <code>react-native run-android</code>.<br>
		You can start it manually using <code>react-native start</code>.
		<br><br><br>
		If you hit a <code>ERROR Watcher took too long to load</code> on Windows, 
		try increasing the timeout in this file (under your <code>node_modules/react-native/</code>).<br><br>
		
		<h1>Modifying your app </h1><br><br>
		Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.<br><br>

		Open <code>index.android.js</code> in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.<br>
		Press the <code>R</code> key twice or select <code>Reload</code> from the Developer Menu to see your change!<br><br>
		
		<h1>That's it!</h1><br>
		Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified a <strong>React Native app</strong>.<br><br>


		<h1>Now What? </h1><br>
		If you want to add this new React Native code to an existing application, check out the <code>Integration guide</code>.<br><br>

		If you can't get this to work, see the <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> page.<br><br>
